0:00:00 : I know Nicholas welcome to one more video on this data structures and algorithms mysterious today. We're going to learn very easy L structures that actually exist believe in our imagination structures are twos and stacks and when I say that is because you are actually going to find them in most languages out there instead tax included or just basically a set of rules that shoot photo of the destructors are known as abstract as data structures or a V8. It is Best Buy, but instead just the behavior of the structure is this means that as long as you follow the rules are we going to discuss you can implement it starts and queues by yourself.
0:00:59 :  Very easy to understand before we can go and just remember how an array looks like because it stalks and q's. I just erased with some restrictions on top to do understand the rules that our stock has to follow listing of a pile of Pancakes in a pile of Pancakes. Then you'll recoup pancake goes on top of the pile pile of panties. You have to eat the pancakes at the top of the pile as tax is an array that you can imagine an array in a vertical position where you can only read when you remove the element at the top of the pile is also called the last in first out ride to my place will be the first one to be eaten about you is very easy to understand because we have all seen people queuing up before waiting for the bus.
0:01:59 :  Front of the queue will be the first one to leave the queue and board the bus aversion to arrived later to lick. You will go to the end of the queue and it will be the last person to board the bus. So i q is just like an array where the first element to get in the queue with me the first element to get out of the cube of this dance is called 50 which means first in first out so let's recap a stock is like a pile of Pancakes where the new element goes on top of the stack and also only from the top of the stack we can read or remove elf in a cue is like a line before boarding the plane where the new element go to the back of the queue and only the elements on the front of the queue can be removed or red.
0:02:59 :  Collection of rules that you can use them and using any real data structure like an array in a couple of function when you click the back button of your browser, you are basically using a sack it when you press the back button, you're going to be basically taking one page from the top of that history or when you are writing something and you keep calling Rosie to undo that is also a stack. If you need to implement undo operations in your application. All you have to do is push the actions that the user has taken to a stuck in the moment that they do on do you can just go back in time in order things to do where the sack behave as an example of a q would be something like a email delivery or push notification system. Maybe even a shopping mall. Where the first order to arrive you this first order to get executed or the back end of a call center. Where the first phone call to the right is the first one to get picked up?
0:03:59 :  Shoes are everywhere and also shoes and socks are used in order a great ever going to see later. We are very easy to understand, but also very very useful even exist in the real world. They give us some rules that allow us to think about our data in a more organized way. Also now if you're working in a company with more people and you see on the code that somebody is using a que hora starts now, you know how it works and what it means.
