      "content": "So what made an algorithm be for a problem that we might want to solve? Well consider this this is an old school problem where you might have lots and lots of names and lots of lots of numbers and those names are hopefully sorted alphabetically from a through z in a book like this. And even though most of us don't really reach for this technology anymore consider that it's really the same as your iPhone or Android phone or other device which has all of your contact top to bottom and you can scroll through them from a to z or you can search for them by typing into the little autocomplete box. How is even your phone solving this problem? Well, let's consider a simple approach. I'm going to look at the first page and look for someone on the phone book suppose that person's name is Mike Smith last name starting with s. Let me go ahead and look down. He's not here. Let me turn the page. Let me turn the page. Let me turn the page. This is an algorithm is a step-by-step process for solving a problem finding Mike Smith. Is this algorithm, correct? Would you say"

      "content": "Yeah, I mean it's pretty slow. It's pretty stupid in that it's going to take my God forever like hundreds of patients to find Mike Smith. But if he's there I will find him according to this step-by-step approach. What if I speed things up a bit just because it's tedious otherwise, so I do 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 and so forth is that algorithm faster absolutely literally twice as fast as it corrects know why?"

    {
      "timestamp": "0:01:22",
      "content": "Yeah, we might skip am I getting unlucky and eventually I might get to like the s's but darn it if Mike wasn't in between two pages as I turn them at once so it's not a fatal flaw that I could fix my thing. If you hit the cheese section for my BSN instead of SMS to back up 1 or so Pages just to fix that that bug or mistakes so to speak but it is twice as fast as I can and something Pages. It's still going to take me maybe like five hundred pairwise turns just to find Mike Smith. That's a while just to look someone up but most of us if you've used this technology and said did what back in the day?"

Now the ends of course mean that Mike is not this way, which would ETA is this weight or disease because as of forces between the m and the Sea, so at this point I can literally"

      "content": "Pair the problem in half of a problem away very dramatically and unnecessarily making the point that we now gone from a thousand so my page as to what 500 and I can do it again a little too far now in the cheese section so I can tear the problem in half again throw that half away. And now I'm down to a from 1,000 to 500 to 250 Pages only after just two steps in the step-by-step process and if I repeat this again and again, and again, hopefully I'll be left ultimately with say just one page on with Mike Smith either is or is not and I can call him or quit."
