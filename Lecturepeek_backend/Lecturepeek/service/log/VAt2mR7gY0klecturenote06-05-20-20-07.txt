      "content": "I like to think about data structures and algorithms using the following analogy. Let's say you've been buying a few books recently as soon as you get a book you stack it on top of the last book. This ingenious organization scheme has been patented by costumes. All of the world has proved to be highly effective. Now, let's say you want to find a specific book from the stack. How would you do it the most straightforward way to find a book is by taking a book off the stack until you find a book that you're looking for."

      "content": "I know what you're thinking. What is this have to do with data structures and algorithms, but believe it or not. You just saw a textbook example of a data structure and an algorithm in this example, you can think of a deer structure as a stack of books and the album we used to find a book is a process of taking books off the top of the stack until we find the book that we are looking for."

      "content": "But as time goes on and you start getting a lot of books you decide to become a little bit more organized and decided to buy a bookshelf and put all your books in alphabetical order by the author's what do we do now if we want to find a book you probably would start in the middle and folding down into the appropriate place of the book based on the order of the alphabet the destruction would be the bookshelf organized alphabetically and your hours would be your search process"

      "content": "Let's say as you get even more books you decide to change your organization seem one more time you now basically have a small library and each self is based on fiction or nonfiction and then the respective genres within each. Johnra. You keep the same alphabetical organization of authors. And now if you want to find a book you can narrow your search the corresponding section here structure is this hierarchical organization of books based on John and your algorithm is the process by which you identify the genre and then found your book so taking a step away from this analogy. I think a really simple way to think about the following data structure is a way to organize information and an algorithm is the way to process information to reach an end goal."

      "content": "Some of the ways of organizing and using information on not at all obvious, but they all have their strengths and weaknesses and a lot of the subject is about understanding these trade-offs the falling videos of introducing fundamental data structures talked about how you'd go about designing them and then talk about their performance after we get through some key data sources will get into that uses data structures to solve a variety of problems."
