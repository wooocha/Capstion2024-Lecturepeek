We can define a whole series of numbers and say that intuitive a variable to be able to find a particular value in this right. We have to specify an index. I need a square bracket send text to daniyah re-access. So for example, if we want to add the value is in the first and third thoughts about Ray J and save that into variable a Wii with white line of code like this race to remember he's pretty straightforward for Simplicity that memory location 1000 the array contains seven numbers and these are stored one offer and every memory as seen him. So when we write J index of the day, right the computer goes to memory location 1000 with an offset 10, we get the value of 5, if we wanted to retrieve J index of 5, I'll program goes to memory vacation 1000."

How come he stole characters way back inside. Then to say the string its memory. You just put it in quite as like psych will do it doesn't look like it is behind the scenes the memory looks like they zero in memory. It's not the character Zero for the binary value zero.

But sometimes you want some manipulate they took his two dimensional like a grid of numbers in a spreadsheet all the pixels on your computer screen for this. We need a matrix you can think of a matrix is an array of a raise. So a three-by-three matrix is really an array of fly 3 with each index during an array of size 3, we could initialize a matrix like so in memory, this is tied together in the valley you need to specify to indexes like Jay index of tooth pain index of one this tells the computer you were looking for the item in subarray to that position one.

We've been storing individual numbers or letters into our raise on mattresses, but often it seems with the store block of related variables together like you might want to start bank account number along with its balance groups are variables. Like these can be bundled together into a struct now, we can create variables on a single numbers but a compound a two structures able to store several pieces of data at once we can even make a raise of struts that we Define which ultimately bundle together in memory if we access for example, j and x and zero we get back the whole strut store that we can pull the specific account number and balance days. We want this array of struts like any other arrangements created a Big Slice of coffee and locked add more items. Also erase memory making it hard to add a new license."

So it doesn't matter we have three notes truck saved in memory allocations 1000 1002 and 1008. They might be spaced apart because they were created at different times and other days I can sit between them. So you see that the first note contains the bunny 7, I'm going to Tatian 1008 and its next point of this means that the next note in the link to that memory location 1812 and points to another night at location 1002 if we follow that we know that contains the Volume 14."

The next points has any place can also easily be real to trim split reverse and so on which is pretty nasty. I'm pretty useful for algorithms likes old things which we talked about last week to this flexibility many more compact data structures are built on top of me list the most famous in Universal accused and stack stack you like the line at your post office goes in the person who's been waiting a long kiss get subs first no matter how frustrating it is.

We have to turn down the base until we hit the end and then change that mix pointed to point to the new person which is the small change we can use meatless has sex with in life. Oh not infest out you can think of this like a stack of pancakes as you make them about them to the top of the site when you want to eat when you take them from the top of the stack Licious instead of entering and a caring they pushed and pulled from the stock if we update our notes truck to contain not just one but two points has we can build trees another day to structure that she's doing many algorithms again program is ready to cut the values of these princes."

He knows that have no children by the tree ends at least notes up to two children and two structures code of binary tree, but you could just as easily have trees with free for any number children by modifying the day to structure accordingly.

So structures is that lives in one way Paul from Greece to eat it be weird if it's connected to leave the connected to Roots, but they said that means I'll prepare everything that includes things like we can either grow facial structure instead.
