      "content": "AUDIENCE: So the worst case scenario if T of n is going to be some constant amount of time-- PROFESSOR: Yep. AUDIENCE: --it takes to investigate whether a certain element is [INAUDIBLE], plus-- [COUGH] --T of n over 2? PROFESSOR: Great. PROFESSOR: Exactly right. That's exactly right. If you look at this algorithm and you say, from a computation standpoint, can I write an equation corresponding to the execution of this algorithm? And you say, T of n is the work that this algorithm does on-- as input of size n. OK? Then I can write this equation. And this theta 1 corresponds to the two comparisons that you do looking at-- potentially the two comparisons that you do-- looking at the left hand side and the right hand side. So that's-- 2 is a constant, so that's why we put theta 1. All right? So you get a cushion, too. Watch out guys. Whoa! Oh actually that wasn't so bad. Good. Veers left, Eric. Veers left. So if you take this and you start expanding it, eventually you're going to get to the base case, which is T of 1 is theta 1. Right? Because you have a one element array you just for that array it's just going to return that as a peak. And so if you do that, and you expand it all the way out, then you can write T of n equals theta 1 plus theta 1. And you're going to do this log to the base 2 of n times. And adding these all up, gives you a complexity theta log 2 of n. Right? So now you compare this with that. And there's really a huge difference. There's an exponential difference. If you coded up this algorithm in Python-- and I did-- both these algorithms for the 1D version-- and if you run it on n being 10 million or so, then this algorithm takes 13 seconds. OK? The-- The theta 10 algorithm takes 13 seconds. And this one takes 0.001 seconds. OK? Huge difference. So there is a big difference between theta n and theta log n. It makes sense to try and reduce complexity as you can see, especially if you're talking about large inputs. All right? And you'll see that more clearly as we go to a 2D version of this problem. All right? So you can't really do better for the 1D. The 1D is a straightforward problem. It gets a little more interesting-- the problems get a little-- excuse me, the algorithms get a little more sophisticated when we look at a 2D version of peak finding. All right? So let's talk about the 2D version. So as you can imagine in the 2D version you have a matrix, or a two dimensional array. And we'll say this thing has n rows and m columns. And now we have to define what a peak is. And it's a hill. It's the obvious definition of a peak. So if you had a in here, c, b, d, e. Then as you can guess, a is a 2D peak if, and only if, a greater than or equal to b; a greater than or equal to d, c and e. So it's a little hill up there. All right? And again I've used the greater than or equal to here, so that's similar to the 1D in the case that you'll always find a peak in any 2D matrix. Now again I'll give you the straightforward algorithm, and we'll call it the Greedy Ascent algorithm. And the Greedy Ascent algorithm essentially picks a direction and, you know, tries to follow that direction in order to find a peak. So for example, if I had this particular-- --matrix; 14, 13, 12, 15, 9, 11, 17-- Then what might happen is if I started at some arbitrary midpoint-- So the Greedy Ascent algorithm has to make choices as to where to start. Just like we had different cases here, you have to make a choice as to where to start. You might want to start in the middle, and you might want to work your way left first. Or you're going to all-- You just keep going left, our keep going right. And if you hit an edge, you go down. So you make some choices as to what the default traversal directions are. And so if you say you want to start with 12, you are going to go look for something to left. And if it's greater than, you're going to follow that direction. If it's not, if it's less, then you're going to go in the other direction, in this case, for example. So in this case you'll go to 12, 13 , 14, 15, 16, 17, 19, and 20. And you'd find-- You 'd find this peak. Now I haven't given you the specific details of a Greedy Ascent algorithm. But I think if you look at the worst case possibilities here, with respect to a given matrix, and for any given starting point, and for any given strategy-- in terms of choosing left first, versus right first, or down first versus up first-- you will have a situation where-- just like we had in the 1D case-- you may end up touching a large fraction of the elements in this 2D array. OK? So in this case, we ended up, you know, touching a bunch of different elements. And it's quite possible that you could end up touching-- starting from the midpoint-- you could up touching half the elements, and in some cases, touching all the elements. So if you do a worst case analysis of this algorithm-- a particular algorithm with particular choices in terms of the starting point and the direction of search-- a Greedy Ascent algorithm would have theta n m complexity. All right? And in the case where n equals m, or m equals n, you'd have theta n squared complexity. OK? I won't spend very much time on this, because I want to talk to you about the divide and conquer versions of this algorithm for the 2D peak. But hopefully you're all with me with respect to what the worst case complexity is. All right? People buy that? Yeah. Question back there. AUDIENCE: Can you-- Is that an approximation? Or can you actually get to n times m traversals? PROFESSOR: So there are specific Greedy Ascent algorithms, and specific matrices where, if I give you the code for the algorithm, and I give you a specific matrix, that I could make you touch all of these elements. That's correct. So we're talking about worst case. You're being very paranoid when you talk about worst case complexity. And so I'm-- hand waving a bit here, simply because I haven't given you the specifics of the algorithm yet. Right? This is really a set of algorithms, because I haven't given you the code, I haven't told you where it starts, and which direction it goes. But you go, do that, fix it, and I would be the person who tries to find the worst case complexity. Suddenly it's very easy to get to theta n m in terms of having some constant multiplying n times m. But you can definitely get to that constant being very close to 1. OK? If not 1. All right. So let's talk about divide and conquer. And let's say that I did something like this, where I just tried to jam the binary search algorithm into the 2D version. All right? So what I'm going to do is-- --I'm going to pick the middle column, j equals m over 2. And I'm going to find a 1D peak using whatever algorithm I want. And I'll probably end up using the more efficient algorithm, the binary search version that's gone all the way to the left of the board there. And let's say I find a binary peak at (i, j). Because I've picked a column, and I'm just finding a 1D peak. So this is j equals m over 2. That's i. Now I use (i,j). In particular row i as a start-- --to find a 1D peak on row i. And I stand up here, I'm really happy. OK? Because I say, wow. I picked a middle column, I found a 1D peak, that is theta m complexity to find a 1D peak as we argued. And one side-- the theta m-- AUDIENCE: Log n. PROFESSOR: Oh, I'm sorry. You're right. The log n complexity, that's what this was. So I do have that here. Yeah. Log n complexity. Thanks, Eric. And then once I do that, I can find a 1D peak on row i. In this case row i would be m wide, so it would be log m complexity. If n equals m, then I have a couple of steps of log n, and I'm done. All right? Am I done? No. Can someone tell me why I'm not done? Precisely? Yep. AUDIENCE: Because when you do the second part to find the peak in row i, you might not have that column peak-- There might not be a peak on the column anymore. PROFESSOR: That's exactly correct. That's exactly correct. So this algorithm is incorrect. OK? It doesn't work. It's efficient, but incorrect. OK? You want to be correct. You know being correcting and inefficient is definitely better than being inefficient-- I'm sorry. Being incorrect and efficient. So this is an efficient algorithm, in the sense that it will only take log n time, but it doesn't work. And I'll give you a simple example here where it doesn't work. Actually this is-- This is exactly the example of that. Let's say that I started with this row. Since it's-- I'm starting with the middle row, and I could start with this one or that one. Let's say I started with that one. I end up finding a peak. And if this were 10 up here, I'd choose 12 as a peak. And it's quite possible that I return 12 as a peak. Even though 19 is bigger, because 12 is a peak given 10 and 11 up here. And then when I choose this particular row, and I find a peak on this row, it would be 14. That is a 1D peak on this row. But 14 is not a 2D peak. OK? So this particular example, 14 would return 14. And 14 is not a 2D peak. All right? So not so good. Look like an efficient algorithm, but doesn't work. All right? So how can we get to something that actually works? So the last algorithm that I'm going to show you-- And you'll see four different algorithms in your problem set-- --that you'll have to analyze the complexity for and decide if they're efficient, and if they're correct. But here's a-- a recursive version that is better than, in terms of complexity, than the Greedy Ascent algorithm. And this one works. So what I'm going to do is pick a middle column. j equals m over 2 as before. I'm going to find the global maximum on column j. And that's going to be at (i, j). I'm going to compare (i comma j minus 1), (i comma j), and (i,j plus 1). Which means that once I've found the maximum in this row, all I'm going to look to the left and the right, and compare. I'm going to pick the left columns. If (i comma j minus 1) is greater than (i comma j)-- and similarly for the right. And if in fact I-- either of these two conditions don't fire, and what I have is (i comma j) is greater than or equal to (i comma j minus 1) and (i comma j plus 1), then I'm done. Just like I had for the 1D version. If (i comma j) is greater than or equal to (i comma j minus 1), and (i comma j plus 1), that implies (i, j) is a 2D peak. OK? And the reason that is the case, is because (i comma j) was the maximum element in that column. So you know that you've compared it to all of the adjacent elements, looking up and looking down, that's the maximum element. Now you've look at the left and the right, and in fact it's greater than or equal to the elements on the left and the right. And so therefore it's a 2D peak. OK? So in this case, when you pick the left or the right columns-- you'll pick one of them-- you're going to solve the new problem with half the number of columns. All right? And again, you have to go through an analysis, or an argument, to make sure that this algorithm is correct. But its intuitively correct, simply because it matches the 1D version much more closely. And you also have your condition where you break away right here, where you have a 2D peak, just like the 1D version. And what you've done is break this matrix up into half the size. And that's essentially why this algorithm works. When you have a single column--"
