Maybe I have more of them than I do inputs, but these are the possible outputs to my problem. And what a problem is is a binary relation between these inputs and outputs. Essentially, for each input, I specify which of these outputs is correct."

There's some kind of mapping here. These edges represent a binary relation, and it's kind of a graph, a bipartite graph between these inputs and outputs. And these are specifying which of these outputs are correct for these inputs. That's really the formal definition of what a problem is."

That would take forever, right? Usually what we do when defining a problem is specify some kind of predicate, saying that, oh, we can check-- if I give you an input and an output, I can check whether that output is correct or not. That's usually how we define a problem is, if I am checking for whether this index contains a 5, I can just go to that array, look at index 5, and-- or the index you gave me, and see if it equals 5. So usually, we're putting it in terms of predicates because, in general, we don't really want to talk about small instances of problems."

All right, well, probably, if there's more than 365 of you, the answer is yes. Right? By what? Pigeonhole principle-- two of you must have the same birthday. So let's generalize it a little bit, say that-- I don't know-- I need a bigger space of birthdays for this question to be interesting. Maybe I tack on the year. Maybe I tack on the hour that you were born. And that's a bigger space of inputs, and I wouldn't necessarily expect that two of you would be born in the same year on the same day in the same hour. That would be a little less likely. In fact, as long as that space is larger than something like the square of the number of you, then I'm less likely than even to have a pair of you. That's a birthday problem you may have seen in 042, potentially."

OK, so in general, in this class, we're not going to concentrate on inputs such as, is there a pair of you in this class that have the same birthday? That's kind of boring. I could do a lot of different things, but what we do in this class-- this is for a fixed classroom of you. I want to make algorithms that are general to any classroom-- to go to your recitation. I want an algorithm that will apply to your recitation. I want an algorithm that not only applies to this classroom, but also the machine learning class before you. I want an algorithm that can change its-- it can accept an arbitrarily sized input. Here we have a class of maybe 300, 400 students, but I want my algorithm to work for a billion students. Maybe I'm trying to check if there's a match of something in the Facebook database or something like that. So in general, we are looking for general problems that have arbitrarily sized inputs. These inputs could grow very large, but we want kind of a fixed size algorithm to solve those problems."

An algorithm is really-- I don't know what the outputs are. I don't know what these edges are. But I want a fixed size machine or procedure that, if I give it an input, it will generate an output. And if it generates an output, it better be one of these correct outputs. So if I have an algorithm that takes in this input, I really want it to output this output, or else it's not a correct algorithm. Similarly, for this one, it could output any of these three outputs, but if it outputs this guy for this input, that would not be a correct algorithm. And so generally, what we want is an algorithm is a function. It takes inputs to outputs. An algorithm is some kind of function that takes these inputs, maps it to a single output, and that output better be correct based on our problem. So that's what our algorithm is. It solves the problem if it returns a correct output for every problem input that is in our domain."

Either the first K already had a match-- in which case, by our inductive hypothesis, we've already returned a correct answer. The other case is the-- it doesn't have a match, and we interview the K plus 1th student-- the K prime plus 1th student. If there is a match in the first K prime plus 1 students, then it will include K plus-- the student K prime plus 1, because otherwise, there would have been a match in the things before it. So there are two cases. If K contains match, K prime. If first K contains match-- already returned by induction. Else, if K prime plus 1 student's contains match, the algorithm checks all of the possibilities-- K prime checks against all students, essentially by brute force. It's a case analysis. I check all of the possibilities. Check if birthday is in record-- I haven't told you how to do that yet, but if I'm able to do that, I'm going to check if it's in the record. If it's in the record, then there will be a match, and I can return it. Otherwise, I have-- re-establish the inductive hypothesis for the K prime plus 1 students."
