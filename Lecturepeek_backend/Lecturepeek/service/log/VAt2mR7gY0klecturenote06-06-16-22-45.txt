      "content": "I like to think about data structures and algorithms using the following analogy. Let's say you've been buying a few books recently. Right now, you have a pretty simple organization scheme. As soon as you get a book, you stack it on top of the last book. This ingenious organization scheme has been patented by college students all over the world and has proved to be highly effective."

    {
      "timestamp": "0:00:32",
      "content": "Now, let's say you want to find a specific book from this stack. How would you do it? The most straightforward way to find a book is by taking a book off the stack until you find the book that you're looking for."

    {
      "timestamp": "0:00:49",
      "content": "I know what you're thinking. What does this have to do with data structures and algorithms? But believe it or not, you just saw a textbook example of a data structure and an algorithm. In this example, you can think of a data structure as our stack of books, and the algorithm we use to find a book is the process of taking books off the top of the stack until we find the book that we are looking for."
    },
    {
      "timestamp": "0:01:19",
      "content": "But as time goes on and you start getting a lot of books, you decide to become a little bit more organized. You decide to buy a bookshelf and put all your books in alphabetical order by the authors. What do we do now if we want to find a book? You probably would start in the middle and slowly hone in to the appropriate place of the book based on the order of the alphabet. Here, the data structure would be the bookshelf organized alphabetically, and your algorithm would be your search process."
    },
    {
      "timestamp": "0:01:54",
      "content": "Now, let's say as you get even more books, you decide to change your organization scheme one more time. You now basically have a small library, and each shelf is split based on fiction or nonfiction and then the respective genre. Within each genre, you keep the same alphabetical organization of authors. And now, if you want to find a book, you can narrow your search to the corresponding section. Here, your data structure is this hierarchical organization of books based on genre, and your algorithm is the process by which you identified the genre and then found your book."
    },
    {
      "timestamp": "0:02:34",
      "content": "So, taking a step away from this analogy, I think a really simple way to think about data structures and algorithms is the following: the data structure is a way to organize information, and an algorithm is a way to process information to reach an end goal. Some of the ways of organizing and using information are not at all obvious, but they all have their strengths and weaknesses, and a lot of the subject is about understanding these trade-offs."

After we get through some key data structures, we'll get into some important algorithms that use these data structures to solve a variety of problems."
